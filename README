This is the directory to place modules to be used in RBot. 
Upon updating a module, and pushing to Git, simply issue a command to 
the IRC bot
  - !rescan

This will automatically load any new plugins that are contained in this directory.

Every module is also replicated automatically to github. Please
be careful of any confidential information contained in an irc module.
